### Future Concepts
* Add crypto trading
  * Letting users invest in crypto-trading will be a fun new feature that will give users the ability to try their hands at investing into the crypto trading world. This will require a similar API to our stock market API, and the integration of the details.

* Messaging feature
  * Adding a competitive edge to the trading game by giving users the ability to message each other about their different trades, and their profits and losses.

* News about companies
  * News about a company can make or break their stock price. Giving users up-to-date information about the company can give them the competitive edge to up their trading game and win big.

* Display earnings ranking
  * Let users compete against each other and their friends by implementing a leader board. Users can see their rankings amongst all users and their friends.

* Transaction history
  * Users will be able to track their progress over time by viewing their purchase history. They can see how much of a stock they bought, at what price, and when they purchased at.
